# Sunflower theme

![Screenshot of the home page](images/screenshot.png)

A clean Hugo theme with yellows and greens using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI components.

## Features

- a page that renders structured data in yaml files into a resume
- special pages for showcasing projects and lecture notes
- a full screen image as landing page, with social icons

## Archetypes

This page provides archetypes to automatically populate the metadata when creating lecture notes and projects:
```shell
hugo new content lecture-notes/post1/index.md
hugo new content projects/post1/index.md
```

## Configuration

For setting up the url for the CV and the sections that should appear:
```toml
[params.cv]
url = "/cv/"
download = "#download"
general = true
education = true
work_experience = true
publications = true
```

The social links in the hero take the following form:
```toml
[params.social.orcid]
link = "#orcid"
```
For now, only a set of links are implemented:
- Email
- Orcid
- Gitlab
- LinkedIn

Menu items can be created like this:
```toml
[menu]
[[menu.main]]
name = "CV"
url = "/cv"
weight = -120
```


```toml
[params]
favicon = "sunflower.png"
hero = "hero.jpg"
mainSections = ["projects", "blog"]
abstract = "This is a site showing the capacities of the sunflower theme for hugo."
```

```toml
